# Title Ideas

* First Responders

# Theme

A bunch of talented first responders who arrive at a scene and attempt to uncover the situation and handle it

# Key Parts

* Cooperative
* You have a character with cool abilities
* Uses an action-subaction system
* Simple components: cubes, meeples, and cards

# "Board" is Cards

* Each "scenario" is an 18-card pack - so you can get a bunch of these packs as expansions
* Floorplan: each scenario has a couple of different floorplans of how the cards get arranged
* Scenario Cards are broken into Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 cards so I can control the progression
* No auto-reveal: you have to look at where you're going, or just go right into it
* Some cards might be see-through, others are not.
* When you do an Observe sub-action, you reveal one adjacent card. Multiple Observes can go down a direction at once.

# Action-Subaction system with Cooldowns

* Each action is a group of subactions, and then it also has a cooldown number
* When you take that action, put the cooldown number of cubes on it.
* At the end of the round, take one cube off of everything
* So there's no randomness in what's available: you're just managing cooldowns

# Sub-Actions

* Move to adjacent
* Sprint 2-3 spaces
* Double-move in the same direction
* Observe: reveal adjacent event
* Treat patient
* Move rubble
* Extinguish
* Disarm bomb (rare! need to call in the bomb squad for it)

# Scenario cards

* Patients: some patients have more severe injuries and will die after a certain number of turns
* Treatment can stabilize them, but then they need to be moved
* Bombs: you need to disarm a bomb by a certain time, and you can delay it but not indefinitely
* Fires: spread and cause explosions on various flammable things
* Rubble: just needs to be cleared, might be flammable, see-through
* Locked door: needs to be cleared, not see-through
* Some cards are see-through, others are not
* Active shooter: causes patients to get hurt
* Panicked victim: if hit by bullet or fire, gets hurt. Panicked.

# Time Advances

* Patients that are revealed get better or worse
* New events get added to the edges of the floorplan?
* Events that haven't been handled get worse
* Events themselves have things that make things worse: so patients get worse, fires get worse, bombs advance
* Panic sets in on your character and surrounding
* Sometimes good things happen too: "someone cracks a joke", lower all panic levels by 1

# Panic

Need to think of a panic system, but that could really tie it all together. Creates the real drama here. Characters panic, NPCs panic. And panic can impact different people in different ways. It might add to your cooldowns, or perhaps you lose your mobility.

* You have a panic card that gives different outcomes as your panic increases
* Panic won't really DECREASE, so you're constantly managing what to do with your character that's getting worse while the situation is also getting worse

# Classes, Adjectives, and Equipment

* Every character gets one adjective, and gets a class-defined amount of equipment

## Class
* Paramedic: moves fast, treats easily, can't treat bad injuries
* Trauma surgeon: treats well, moves slow, needs a paramedic
* Chief: dispatches and handles extra squads
* Firefighter: clears rubble well, moves slow, extinguishes bombs, lowers NPC panic
* Cop: subdues or eliminates violent threats, moves fast

## Specialists (NPCs)

Your character can call in an NPC and you get to control them if you called them. These are much simpler, one-card characters.

* Hazmat
* Hostage negotiator
* Bomb defuser

## Adjectives

* Keen-eyed: can observe multiple event cards in a row
* Mobile: can move quickly
* Resilient: doesn't panic as easily
* Experienced: resets cooldowns easier
* Calming: lowers NPC panic easier
* Strong: moves rubble easier

## Equipment

* Medical stuff (more specific?)
* Jaws of Life
* Halligan
* Extinguisher
* Assault rifle
* Bomb defusing kit
* Body camera: automatically observes


# From my Phone

Here's a dump from my phone, will organize next.

Prepared: lower cooldown of any action involving X

Research: reveal a “situation” card to help deduce what’s going on. So it’s NOT an active shooter for example. Long-term goal to balance with short-term goals.  

Situations are ambiguous but give clues. Level 1 you have 1 clue, and then generic stuff, maybe level 2 you have more. Level 3 is where you really need specialist to bring in. But is it too late?

So the situation cards define maybe 6-8 of the cards. And maybe some of those situation cards are just extra rubble, or extra gunshot victims, or whatever. The clue might be in proportion, not a particular card.

Community volunteer specialist: they can help reveal a level 3 card.

“Connected” - calling a new NPC is easier

Natural disasters

Action surge: you can use an extra action this round, and you get a limited number of those per game. Like 1 or 2.

Study pile: if you “study” an event card, you add a token to the pile. At 3,5,7, and 8 you get to reveal a situation card. Cards with a magnifying glass can be studied.

“Studious” - get to add a free study to any action that’s not Sprint.

Subaction: calm person

Negotiate: (phone emoji) is a specialty one

Rescue squad: good at stabilizing, clearing rubble

Event cards have types:

Rubble
Trap
Victim
Enemy
Hazards

Events also have

open/closed for line of sight
A study icon (or two)
Place for art
Description box

Should we carry out victims? Or is that too much? Maybe doesn’t fit the first ten minutes.

And then classes and traits can give you bonuses to each type

=== Events ===

Injury: treatment goes up each round after 3 (victim)

Grievous injury: panic on first character there (victim)

Panicked civilian: calm them first, otherwise they take an injury each round (victim)

Civilian defusing a bomb: final situation card (trap, victim)

Collapsing rubble. Anyone who goes there will get trapped until 3 Clears. (Rubble, trap)

Chemical spill: needs hazmat otherwise all adjacent victims take damage and characters take a panic (hazard)

Shooter trap: if you go there you are held hostage and can only get a hostage negotiator to get out. Has a bunch of study opportunities

Victim trap: they grab onto you and you can’t leave until you treat them

Shooter: when there’s a clear line of sight they shoot and cause panic or injury

Airplane crash: mega hazmat situation and lots of victims. Hurts all non-stabilized victims.

Train crash: linear floorplan, chemical hazards

Chemical factory

Boat crashes into docks

On a boat that blows up: a certain amount of rubble collapses sinks

Skyscraper falls down
(Look up split second game)

Suicide bomber (enemy, hazard)

Suicide shooter (enemy, victim)

Shooter behind cover (rubble, enemy)
