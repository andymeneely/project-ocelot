# Title Ideas

* First Responders

# Theme

A bunch of talented first responders who arrive at a scene and attempt to uncover the situation and handle it

# Key Parts

* Cooperative
* You have a character with cool abilities
* Uses an action-subaction system
* Simple components: cubes, meeples, and cards

# "Board" is Cards

* Each "scenario" is an 18-card pack - so you can get a bunch of these packs as expansions
* Floorplan: each scenario has a couple of different floorplans of how the cards get arranged
* Scenario Cards are broken into Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 cards so I can control the progression
* No auto-reveal: you have to look at where you're going, or just go right into it
* Some cards might be see-through, others are not.
* When you do an Observe sub-action, you reveal one adjacent card. Multiple Observes can go down a direction at once.

# Action-Subaction system with Cooldowns

* Each action is a group of subactions, and then it also has a cooldown number
* When you take that action, put the cooldown number of cubes on it.
* At the end of the round, take one cube off of everything
* So there's no randomness in what's available: you're just managing cooldowns
* Action surge: you can use an extra action this round, and you get a limited number of those per game. Like 1 or 2.

# Sub-Actions

* Move to adjacent ‚ûú
* Observe: reveal adjacent event
* Analyze: add an Analysis token, eventually eliminating Scenarios üîç
* Treat: add a medical token
* Clear rubble
* Extinguish fire
* Calm person: remove a panic token
* Call specialist
* Disarm bomb (rare! need to call in the bomb squad for it)
* Negotiate: (phone emoji) is a specialty one only Negotiator has
* Contain: (phone emoji) is a specialty of Hazmat teams, and maybe someone has one with a huge cooldown.

# Situations and Scenario

## Scenario

You don't know what the scenario is, and the sooner you find out the better.

Analyze: reveal a ‚Äúsituation‚Äù card to help deduce what‚Äôs going on. So it‚Äôs NOT an active shooter for example. Long-term goal to balance with short-term goals.

Analysis Pile: if you "analyze" a situation card, you add a token to the pile. At 3,5,7, and 8 you get to reveal a Scenario card. Cards with a magnifying glass can be studied.

Situations are ambiguous but give clues. Level 1 you have 1 clue, and then generic stuff, maybe level 2 you have more. Level 3 is where you really need specialist to bring in. But is it too late?

So the situation cards define maybe 6-8 of the cards. And maybe some of those situation cards are just extra rubble, or extra gunshot victims, or whatever. The clue might be in proportion, not a particular card.

## Situation Types

Every card will have 1-3 types as a "subtitle"

* Rubble
* Trap
* Victim
* Enemy
* Hazards

Every situation card has:

* Name
* Types
* open/closed for line of sight (eye, closed eye)
* A study icon (or two) (magnifying glass)
* Place for art
* Row of icon boxes to handle: injury, rubble, panic, fire, chemical, delay
* Description box

Description box covers things like:
* "Rounds 3,4, & 5: add injury if not already stabilized"
* "Characters cannot exit until rubble is cleared"
* "Characters cannot exit until panic is cleared"
* "Rounds 3,4, & 5: add Fire if not already extinguished"
* "If explosion is reached, add injury to all adjacent victims"
* "If chemical spills, add injury to all surrounding victims"

## Scenario Cards

Here are some of the scenarios we could do. Here's some crazy ideas:
* Skyscraper falls down (look up split second game),
* Train crash: linear floorplan, chemical hazards
* Airplane crash: mega hazmat situation and lots of victims. Hurts all non-stabilized victims.
* Chemical factory
* Boat crashes into docks
* On a boat that blows up: a certain amount of rubble collapses sinks

### Chemical Spill

* Adds extra hazmats to the pile
* One big hazmat to handle at the end

### Active Shooter


## Situation Cards

Note: design should be such that when you flip over a card you start with cubes. A card with no cubes is "handled".

* Injury: treatment goes up each round after 3 (victim), some patients have more severe injuries and will die after a certain number of turns. Treatment can stabilize them, but then they need to be moved
* Bombs: you need to disarm a bomb by a certain time, and you can delay it but not indefinitely (hazard)
* Fires: spread and cause explosions on various flammable things (hazard)
* Backdraft: spread and cause explosions and panics (hazard)
* Rubble: just needs to be cleared, might be flammable, see-through (rubble)
* Locked door: needs to be cleared, not see-through
* Some cards are see-through, others are not
* Active shooter: causes patients to get hurt
* Panicked victim: if hit by bullet or fire, gets hurt. Panicked.
* Grievous injury: panic on first character there (victim)
* Panicked civilian: calm them first, otherwise they take an injury each round (victim)
* Civilian defusing a bomb: final situation card (trap, victim)
* Collapsing rubble. Anyone who goes there will get trapped until 3 Clears. (Rubble, trap)
* Chemical spill: needs hazmat otherwise all adjacent victims take damage and characters take a panic (hazard)
* Shooter trap: if you go there you are held hostage and can only get a hostage negotiator to get out. Has a bunch of study opportunities
* Victim trap: they grab onto you and you can‚Äôt leave until you treat them
* Shooter: when there‚Äôs a clear line of sight they shoot and cause panic or injury
* Suicide bomber (enemy, hazard)
* Suicide shooter (enemy, victim)
* Shooter behind cover (rubble, enemy)

# Time Advances

* Patients that are revealed get better or worse
* New events get added to the edges of the floorplan?
* Events that haven't been handled get worse
* Events themselves have things that make things worse: so patients get worse, fires get worse, bombs advance
* Panic sets in on your character and surrounding
* Sometimes good things happen too: "someone cracks a joke", lower all panic levels by 1

# Panic

Need to think of a panic system, but that could really tie it all together. Creates the real drama here. Characters panic, NPCs panic. And panic can impact different people in different ways. It might add to your cooldowns, or perhaps you lose your mobility.

* You have a panic card that gives different outcomes as your panic increases
* Panic won't really DECREASE, so you're constantly managing what to do with your character that's getting worse while the situation is also getting worse

# Classes, Adjectives, and Equipment

* Every character gets one adjective, and gets a class-defined amount of equipment

## Class

We can definitely have two copies of each card since we also have attributes.

* Good Samaritan: moves very fast, panics easily, gets an extra trait, extra surges
* Paramedic: moves fast, treats easily, can't treat bad injuries
* Chief: dispatches and handles extra squads
* Firefighter: clears rubble well, moves slow, extinguishes bombs, lowers NPC panic
* Cop: subdues or eliminates violent threats, moves fast

## Specialists (NPCs)

Your character can call in an NPC and you get to control them if you called them. These are much simpler, one-card characters.

* Hazmat team
* Hostage negotiator
* Bomb Squad: only ones with a defuse action
* Field surgeon: treats well, moves slow, needs a paramedic
* Rescue squad: good at stabilizing, clearing rubble
* Community hero: they can help reveal a level 3 card.

## Adjectives

* Keen-eyed: can observe multiple event cards in a row
* Mobile: can move quickly - double-move if in a straight line
* Resilient: doesn't panic as easily
* Experienced: resets cooldowns easier
* Calming: lowers NPC panic easier
* Strong: moves rubble easier
* Prepared: lower cooldown of any action involving X
* Connected: calling a new NPC is easier
* Analytical: get a free Analyze to any action that has 2 or fewer sub-actions
* Resurgent: when things are bad, you get a big boost

## Equipment

Maybe you can pick up equipment if you are outside for an action. So you don't need it, but you can run back out to get it.

* Medical stuff (more specific?)
* Jaws of Life
* Halligan
* Extinguisher
* Assault rifle
* Bomb defusing kit
* Body camera: automatically observes
