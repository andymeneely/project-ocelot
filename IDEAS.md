# Title Ideas

* First Responders

# Theme

A bunch of talented first responders who arrive at a scene and attempt to uncover the situation and handle it

# Key Parts

* Cooperative
* You have a character with cool abilities
* Uses an action-subaction system
* Simple components: cubes, meeples, and cards

# "Board" is Cards

* Each "scenario" is an 18-card pack - so you can get a bunch of these packs as expansions
* Floorplan: each scenario has a couple of different floorplans of how the cards get arranged
* Scenario Cards are broken into Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3 cards so I can control the progression
* No auto-reveal: you have to look at where you're going, or just go right into it
* Some cards might be see-through, others are not.
* When you do an Observe sub-action, you reveal one adjacent card. Multiple Observes can go down a direction at once.

# Action-Subaction system with Cooldowns

* Each action is a group of subactions, and then it also has a cooldown number
* When you take that action, put the cooldown number of cubes on it.
* At the end of the round, take one cube off of everything
* So there's no randomness in what's available: you're just managing cooldowns

# Sub-Actions

* Move to adjacent
* Sprint 2-3 spaces
* Double-move in the same direction
* Observe: reveal adjacent event
* Treat patient
* Move rubble
* Extinguish
* Disarm bomb (rare! need to call in the bomb squad for it)

# Scenario cards

* Patients: some patients have more severe injuries and will die after a certain number of turns
* Treatment can stabilize them, but then they need to be moved
* Bombs: you need to disarm a bomb by a certain time, and you can delay it but not indefinitely
* Fires: spread and cause explosions on various flammable things
* Rubble: just needs to be cleared, might be flammable, see-through
* Locked door: needs to be cleared, not see-through
* Some cards are see-through, others are not
* Active shooter: causes patients to get hurt
* Panicked victim: if hit by bullet or fire, gets hurt. Panicked.

# Time Advances

* Patients that are revealed get better or worse
* New events get added to the edges of the floorplan?
* Events that haven't been handled get worse
* Events themselves have things that make things worse: so patients get worse, fires get worse, bombs advance
* Panic sets in on your character and surrounding
* Sometimes good things happen too: "someone cracks a joke", lower all panic levels by 1

# Panic

Need to think of a panic system, but that could really tie it all together. Creates the real drama here. Characters panic, NPCs panic. And panic can impact different people in different ways. It might add to your cooldowns, or perhaps you lose your mobility.

* You have a panic card that gives different outcomes as your panic increases
* Panic won't really DECREASE, so you're constantly managing what to do with your character that's getting worse while the situation is also getting worse

# Classes, Adjectives, and Equipment

* Every character gets one adjective, and gets a class-defined amount of equipment

## Class
* Paramedic: moves fast, treats easily, can't treat bad injuries
* Trauma surgeon: treats well, moves slow, needs a paramedic
* Chief: dispatches and handles extra squads
* Firefighter: clears rubble well, moves slow, extinguishes bombs, lowers NPC panic
* Cop: subdues or eliminates violent threats, moves fast

## Specialists (NPCs)

Your character can call in an NPC and you get to control them if you called them. These are much simpler, one-card characters.

* Hazmat
* Hostage negotiator
* Bomb defuser

## Adjectives

* Keen-eyed: can observe multiple event cards in a row
* Mobile: can move quickly
* Resilient: doesn't panic as easily
* Experienced: resets cooldowns easier
* Calming: lowers NPC panic easier
* Strong: moves rubble easier

## Equipment

* Medical stuff (more specific?)
* Jaws of Life
* Halligan
* Extinguisher
* Assault rifle
* Bomb defusing kit
* Body camera: automatically observes
